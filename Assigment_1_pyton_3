#  ---------------------- Hello -------------------------
# INSTRUCTIONS
#
# In this program, you must ask the user:
#	"What is your name?"
#
# And then respond by printing out a personalized greeting.
# GENERAL RULE
#
# For a person named Maria, respond by printing:
#	Hello Maria :)
#
# For a person named Wally, respond by printing:
#	Hello Wally :)
#
# ...etc.
#
# In general, for a person named <NAME>, respond by printing:
#	Hello <NAME>
# SPECIAL NAMES
#
# Two people are special: Amar and Brandy.
# A person named Amar or Brandy should receive an additional comment after you say hello
#
# For a person named Amar, respond by saying:
#	Hello Amar :)
#	I like your shoes
#
# For a person named Brandy, respond by saying:
#	Hello Brandy :)
#	You seem like a cool person
# Note that the robot grader will only mark your solution correct if your
# print statements match EXACTLY what was specified above.
#
#	Spelling, spacing, punctuation... all that stuff matters.
#
#	Your input statement also matters. You must say it exactly like this:
#		What is your name?
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# Put your Python code here:
name = input("What is your name? ")
if name ==  "Amar":
    print("Hello Amar :)" + "\n" + "I like your shoes")
elif name == "Brandy":
    print("Hello Brandy :)" + "\n" + "You seem like a cool person")
else: print("Hello " + name + " :)")

from builtins import input

#name = raw_input("What is your name? ")
#if name ==  "Amar":
 #   print("Hello Amar :)" + "\n" + "I like your shoes")
#elif name == "Brandy":
 #   print("Hello Brandy :)" + "\n" + "You seem like a cool person")
#else: print("Hello " + name + " :)")
